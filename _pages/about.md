Sanghun Shin is a Ph.D. candidate in the **Technology Management, Economics and Policy Program (TEMEP)** at **Seoul National University**, specializing in computational modeling of complex socio-technical systems. His dissertation, *"The Cascade Paradox,"* investigates emergent phenomena in human-AI hybrid networks, including affective pathway dominance in trust dynamics and protective network segregation.

His interdisciplinary background spans nanomaterial chemistry, biomedical engineering, and computational social science. Prior to his doctoral studies, he conducted research at the NSF-funded nanomaterial synthesis lab at UW-Madison and the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), publishing in high-impact journals including *ACS Nano* and *Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters*. He brings industry experience from strategic planning at Dongwha Pharm and medical AI research at Asan Medical Center.

## Research Interests

- **Human-AI Hybrid Networks:** Trust dynamics, cultural evolution, and emergent phenomena in AI-integrated social systems
- **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM):** Computational simulation of complex socio-economic systems and policy interventions
- **Smart Textiles & Wearable Robotics:** Discrete Elastic Rods (DER) simulation for SMA-based active knits and morphological computation
- **Nanomaterials & Biomedical Engineering:** Therapeutic nanoparticle systems, quantum dot heterostructures, medical imaging AI
