I am a Ph.D. candidate in the **Technology Management, Economics and Policy Program (TEMEP)** at **Seoul National University**, Seoul, Republic of Korea. I am also affiliated with the Integrated Major in Smart City Global Convergence at Seoul National University.

My research interests lie in **applied artificial intelligence** and **social simulation**, with emphasis on computational modeling of complex societal dynamics using agent-based approaches and advanced AI techniques. Through this interdisciplinary approach, I develop novel frameworks for analyzing emergent patterns in social systems and designing intelligent solutions for real-world challenges, while exploring how emerging technologies transform future communities.
