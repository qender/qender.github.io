My research goal is to combine **applied artificial intelligence** and **social simulation** to study complex societal dynamics. I develop novel computational frameworks that integrate agent-based modeling and advanced AI techniques to analyze emergent patterns in social systems and design intelligent solutions for real-world challenges.

A key focus of my work is exploring how **emerging technologies**—including wearable robotics, smart city infrastructure, and AI-driven systems—transform future communities and how individuals and societies respond to and adopt these technologies.

## Technology Acceptance & Wearable Robotics

One of my current research streams investigates the factors that determine user acceptance and adoption of wearable robot technology. Using a UTAUT2-integrated SEM and ANN approach, I analyzed data from 200 adults to identify the critical predictors of behavioural intention and actual usage behaviour.

Key findings reveal that **habit** is the dominant predictor of wearable robot adoption, followed by performance expectancy, price value, and hedonic motivation. These insights have practical implications for designers and policymakers aiming to promote the diffusion of assistive robotics in everyday life.

## Agent-Based Modeling & Complex Societal Dynamics

I am also engaged in research that employs agent-based modeling (ABM) to simulate emergent social phenomena. This work explores how individual-level behaviors and interactions give rise to macro-level societal patterns, offering insights for policy planning and intervention design in domains such as urban systems and smart cities.
