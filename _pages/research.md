## Dissertation: The Cascade Paradox

*The Cascade Paradox: Complexity and Criticality in Scaled Systems* (2020–Present, Advisor: Prof. Junseok Hwang)

This dissertation investigates emergent phenomena in **human-AI hybrid networks** using agent-based modeling. Key findings include:
- **Affective pathway dominance** (89% mediation) in trust dynamics
- **Protective network segregation** as an emergent self-organizing behavior in AI-integrated social systems

The work contributes a formal computational account of how affective channels can dominate information-rational pathways in human-AI co-systems, with implications for AI governance and sociotechnical design.

## Current Projects

### SMA Active Knit Simulation (2024–Present)
*(Collaboration with Prof. Soo-Min Lee, Kyung Hee University)*

GPU-accelerated **Discrete Elastic Rods (DER)** simulation for topological jamming mechanics in shape memory alloy (SMA) knitted actuators. This project bridges computational mechanics and smart textile design, targeting morphological computation in soft robotics.

**Target journal:** *Journal of Industrial Textiles*

### Pedestrian-Exoskeleton Crosswalk Simulation (2024–Present)

Agent-based modeling of mixed pedestrian populations interacting with exoskeleton users at urban crosswalks using the **Social Force Model**. Safety metrics include Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Post-Encroachment Time (PET).

**Target journal:** *Gait & Posture*

### Wearable Robotics User Acceptance (2024–Present)

Empirical investigation of factors driving **user behavioural intention and usage behaviour** for wearable robots, combining PLS-SEM and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods within the UTAUT2 framework.
