This dissertation presents an agent-based computational account of emergent phenomena in human-AI hybrid networks. Key findings include:

- **Affective pathway dominance** (89% mediation) — affective channels dominate information-rational pathways in human-AI co-systems
- **Protective network segregation** — an emergent self-organizing behavior whereby human agents form segregated subnetworks in response to AI integration

The work contributes formal modeling frameworks for trust dynamics and cultural evolution in AI-integrated social systems, with implications for AI governance and sociotechnical design.
