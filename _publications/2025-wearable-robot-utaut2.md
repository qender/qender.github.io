**Abstract:**

This study analyzed key factors influencing user behavioural intention and usage behaviour for wearable robot technology, grounded in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). A combined Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) framework was applied to survey data from 200 adults.

Key findings indicate that **habit** is the most critical predictor of behavioural intention, followed by performance expectancy, price value, and hedonic motivation. Effort expectancy and social influence were not found to be significant predictors. User experience acts as a key moderating variable in the adoption of wearable robotics.
