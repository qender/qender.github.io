This study analyzed key factors influencing user behavioural intention and usage behaviour for wearable robot technology, grounded in UTAUT2. A combined PLS-SEM and ANN framework was applied to survey data from 200 adults.

Key findings: **habit** is the most critical predictor of behavioural intention, followed by performance expectancy, price value, and hedonic motivation. User experience acts as a key moderating variable.
